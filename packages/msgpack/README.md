[![Package Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@urlpack/msgpack)](https://npm.im/@urlpack/msgpack)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/@urlpack/msgpack)](#License)
[![Bundle Size](https://img.shields.io/bundlephobia/minzip/@urlpack/msgpack)](https://bundlephobia.com/package/@urlpack/msgpack)

Pure JavaScript implementation of the [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org/) codec. (See [specification](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack/blob/master/spec.md))

- Lightweight (only ~3KB min-gzipped)
- Zero dependencies (No Node.js dependencies)
- ES Modules & Web compatible
- Tree-shakable, DCE-friendly both encoder and decoder

## Usage

```ts
import { makeMessagePackEncoder, makeMessagePackDecoder } from '@urlpack/msgpack';

const encoder = makeMessagePackEncoder();
const decoder = makeMessagePackDecoder();

encoder.encode(data); // JSON => Uint8Array
decoder.decode(binary); // Uint8Array => JSON
```

### Using custom extensions

You can use your own [extension](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack/blob/master/spec.md#extension-types) codecs.

encoder:
```ts
import type { EncoderExtension } from '@urlpack/msgpack';

const myEncoderExtension: EncoderExtension<MyObject> = {
  type: 1, // 0 ~ 127

  check(input): input is MyObject {
    // validate input object is my extension type
  },

  encode(input) {/* encode input object to binary */}
};

const encoderExt = makeMessagePackEncoder({
  encoderExtensions: [myEncoderExtension],
});
```

decoder:
```ts
import type { DecoderExtension } from '@urlpack/msgpack';

const myDecoderExtension: DecoderExtension<MyObject> = {
  type: 1, // 0 ~ 127

  /**
   * - binary is Uint8Array that start from data part
   * - byteLength notice how many bytes you have to read
   */
  decode(binary, length) { /* should returns decoded MyObject */ },
};

const decoderExt = makeMessagePackDecoder({
  decoderExtensions: [myDecoderExtension],
});
```

## About performance

The current implementation is not that optimized.

It is suitable for use as a callback for webpage that doesn't run the codec at high frequency, etc.

If you are dealing with large data or want very high-performance, We recommend using the [official JS implementation](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-javascript) or [msgpackr](https://github.com/kriszyp/msgpackr).

## Benchmark

Run on Desktop (Intel i5-9600K (6) @ 4.600GHz), Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS x86_64 and Node.js v16.10.0 (v8 9.3.345.19)

* Packages should provide an ESM bundle and an export map so that it can be resolved on the Node.js environment.
* Encoder and decoder should be separated modules to eliminate unnecessary code on a production build.
* Additional shims are required for browsers if the package depends on Node APIs (e.g. `Buffer`).
